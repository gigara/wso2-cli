// Package oidcdiscovery is the one OpenID discovery every part of the shell

// HTTP client, which issuertrust, imported by context validation, must not.

// Discover reads the OpenID configuration of the provider at issuer, over the
// HTTP client ctx carries (oidc.ClientContext), and refuses one the shell may
// not use. issuerID is the issuer identifier the context declares the
// provider names, empty when it names issuer itself as OpenID Connect
// Discovery requires.
//
// A declared issuerID is handed to go-oidc through InsecureIssuerURLContext:
// the configuration is still fetched from issuer, and the identifier every
// identity token is later verified against becomes issuerID. That facility
// drops the library's own comparison of the two outright, so Discover makes
// it instead: the provider must name exactly issuerID, never whatever it
// chooses. See ADR 0020.
//
// Every error is a problem.Problem, and none repeats what the provider said
// beyond the issuer identifier it names: the provider's error text may quote
// the request that produced it, and the shell renders problems verbatim. Two
// causes are named because each has its own remedy: an untrusted certificate,
// which every fresh self-hosted deployment fails with, and a provider naming
// an issuer other than the one expected. Everything else stays the closed
// discovery failure, because guessing among the rest would put the shell in
// the position of explaining a deployment it cannot see.
